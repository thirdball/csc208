        ```
        ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q']" -p "['(p or q) => q']" -i False
        +-----+-----+-----------------+
        |  p  |  q  |  (p or q) => q  |
        |-----+-----+-----------------|
        |  1  |  1  |        1        |
        |  1  |  0  |        0        |
        |  0  |  1  |        1        |
        |  0  |  0  |        1        |
        +-----+-----+-----------------+
        ```

    d. I can conclude that its not your birthday.

    e. There won't be cake if it's your birthday.

    ```
    ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q']" -p "['(p or q) => (p and q)']" -i False
    +-----+-----+-------------------------+
    |  p  |  q  |  (p or q) => (p and q)  |
    |-----+-----+-------------------------|
    |  1  |  1  |            1            |
    |  1  |  0  |            0            |
    |  0  |  1  |            0            |
    |  0  |  0  |            1            |
    +-----+-----+-------------------------+
    ```
3. 
    ```
    ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q', 'r']" -p "['~p and (q=>p)']" -i False
    +-----+-----+-----+-----------------+
    |  p  |  q  |  r  |  ~p and (q=>p)  |
    |-----+-----+-----+-----------------|
    |  1  |  1  |  1  |        0        |
    |  1  |  1  |  0  |        0        |
    |  1  |  0  |  1  |        0        |
    |  1  |  0  |  0  |        0        |
    |  0  |  1  |  1  |        0        |
    |  0  |  1  |  0  |        0        |
    |  0  |  0  |  1  |        1        |
    |  0  |  0  |  0  |        1        |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----------------+
    ```
    I can conclude that when P and Q are true the statement is true, otherwise it is false.
