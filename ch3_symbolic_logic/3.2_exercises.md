1. Consider the statement “for all integers A 
 and B, if A+B is even, then A and B are even”

a) Write the contrapositive of the statement.

for all integers A and B,if A and B are odd, then A+B is odd.

b) Write the converse of the statement.

If A and B are even, then A+B are even.

c) Write the negation of the statement.

There exists numbers where A+B is even, but A and B are not even.

d) Is the original statement true or false? Prove your answer.

The orignial statement is false. A counter example would be $1 + 1 = 2$. A and B in this case are both odd.

e) Is the contrapositive of the original statement true or false? Prove your answer.

False. Using the previous example again, $1+1=2$ and 2 is even, so it's false.

f) Is the converse of the original statement true or false? Prove your answer.

True. When A and B are even, then $A = 2C$ and $B = 2D$ with some integers C and D. We know that $A + B = 2C + 2D = 2(C+D)$. Anything integer doubled has to be even, so this is true.

Is the negation of the original statement true or false? Prove your answer.

True. For example, $1+1=2$ is an equation where A and B are odd, but $A+B$ are even.
