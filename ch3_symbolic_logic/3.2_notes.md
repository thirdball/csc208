The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a **direct proof**.

**Direct Proof**: Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of
what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when proving
implications. 


**Proof by Contrapositive**: Recall that an implication P → Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive
¬Q → ¬P. There are plenty of examples of statements which are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved directly. This is all that proof by contrapositive does. It gives a direct proof of thecontrapositive of the implication. 

**Proof by Contradiction**: If we can prove that ¬Pleads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that ¬P is false, so P is
true. That’s what we wanted to prove. In other words, if it is impossible
for P to be false, P must be true.

**Proof by Counterexample**:  Since so many statements in mathematics
are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a
statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample. 


(If you are trying to prove a statementof the form ∀xP(x), you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example.
However, existential statements can be proven this way.)
