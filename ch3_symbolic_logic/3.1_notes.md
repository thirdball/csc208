# 3.1 Notes

An **argument** is a set of statements, one of which is called theconclusion and the rest of which are called premises. An argument
is said to be **valid** if the conclusion must be true whenever the
premises are all true. An argument is **invalid** if it is not valid; it is
possible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.

For example, consider the following two arguments:
- If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie.
- Edith eats her vegetables.
___
∴ Edith gets a cookie.

- Florence must eat her vegetables in order to get a cookie.
- Florence eats her vegetables.
___
∴ Florence gets a cookie. 
> "∴" means "therefore"

A **proposition** is simply a statement. Propositional logic studies the
ways statements can interact with each other. 

Logically equivalent statements:

- $\lnot(P \lor Q)$ and $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$ 
- $P \rightarrow Q$ and $\lnot P \lor Q$
