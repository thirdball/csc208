#### Implications part 1
###### By Ivan & Caleb

An implication is basically an "if...then" statement.

Example: 

 **P -> Q**: If statement P is true, then statement Q must also be true.

**Inverse**: The inverse of P -> Q is -P -> -Q. If P is false, then Q must be false.

**Biconditional**: P if and only if Q, denoted as P <-> Q. Both P -> Q and Q -> P are true.
