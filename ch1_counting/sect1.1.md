### 1. Your wardrobe consists of 5 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, and 17 bow ties. How many different outfits can you make?

 Answer: 255

Here, use the multiplicitive property since an outfit consists of a shirt, pair of pants and a bow tie.
Using the multiplicitive property, multiply each item of clothing to get the total number of possible combinations:

5 x 3 x 17 = 255

This gives the total number of possible  outfits.


### 2. For your college interview, you must wear a tie. You own 3 regular (boring) ties and 5 (cool) bow ties.
(A) How many choices do you have for your neck-wear?
Answer: 8 ties

Since there are no combinations, use the additive property and add all the ties cause you can only wear one tie at a time. 
3 + 5 = 8 
This will give you the total amount of ties a.k.a the amount of choices you have.

### 7. A group of college students were asked about their TV watching habits. Of those surveyed, 28 students watch The Walking Dead, 19 watch The Blacklist, and 24 watch Game of Thrones. Additionally, 16 watch The Walking Dead and The Blacklist, 14 watch The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, and 10 watch The Blacklist and Game of Thrones. There are 8 students who watch all three shows. How many students surveyed watched at least one of the shows?

Answer: 39

Use a triple venn diagram:
28 + 19 + 24 - 16 - 14 - 10 + 8 = 39
