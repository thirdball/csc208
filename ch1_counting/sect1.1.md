### 1. Your wardrobe consists of 5 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, and 17 bow ties. How many different outfits can you make?

 Answer: 255

Here, use the multiplicitive property since an outfit consists of a shirt, pair of pants and a bow tie.
Using the multiplicitive property, multiply each item of clothing to get the total number of possible combinations:

5 x 3 x 17 = 255

This gives the total number of possible  outfits.


### 2. For your college interview, you must wear a tie. You own 3 regular (boring) ties and 5 (cool) bow ties.
(A) How many choices do you have for your neck-wear?
Answer: 8 ties

Since there are no combinations, use the additive property and add all the ties cause you can only wear one tie at a time. 
3 + 5 = 8 
This will give you the total amount of ties a.k.a the amount of choices you have.
