# Chapter 1.2 Notes

### Bit Strings
Bit is short for binary digit, so a bit string is just a string of binary digits from 0 to 1.
Examples:
101010   0   1111111

- An n-bit string is a bit string of length n. It contains n symbols, which each are a bit of either 1 or 0.
- The weight of a bit string is the number of 1's in it.

### Lattice Paths
The integer lattice is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which both the x and y coordinates are integers.

A lattice path is one of the shortest paths connecting two points on a lattice.

For example, a lattice path connecting the coordinates (0,0) and (3,2) would have to have only 5 steps. Some lattice paths would be (U meaning up and R meaning right) UUURR and RURUR.
