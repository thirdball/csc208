# Additive and Multiplicative Principles

**Additive:** The additive principle states that if event A can occur in m ways,
and event B can occur in n disjoint ways, then the event “A or B” can occur in m + n ways.

**Multiplicative**: The multiplicative principle states that if event A can occur in m
ways, and each possibility for A allows for exactly n ways for event B, then the event “A and B” can occur in m · n ways.
