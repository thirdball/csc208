# 2.1 Notes
A sequence is simply an ordered list of numbers. For example, here
is a sequence: 
>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . 

This is different from the set N because,
while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural
numbers, in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers
come in. For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a
sequence they will look like this:
>$a_0,a_1,a_2...$
