# 2.3 Exercises

1. Use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the nth term of thesequence $(a_n)_{nâ‰¥0}$ which starts,
$$ 0, 2, 6, 12, 20 $$

Differences between each term are 2, 4, 6,... increasing by 2 for each term. This is a constant second diffrence, so we know were looking for a quadratic. Since $a_n = 0$, $c=0$. Plugging in n=1 & n=2 gives us the equations:
$$ 2=a+b $$
$$ 6 = 4a+2b $$
Solving shows that a = 1 and b = 1, so the the formula is $a_n = n^2 + n $.
