1. Find the closed formula for each of the following sequences by relating
them to a well known sequence. Assume the first term given is a1.
>(a) 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, . . .

The sequence above consists of all numbers that are 1 more than a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, 25). With that, the formula would be $a_n = n^2 +1$
