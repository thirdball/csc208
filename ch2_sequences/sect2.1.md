### 1. Find the closed formula for each of the following sequences by relating them to a well known sequence. Assume the first term given is a1.
>(a) 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, . . .

The sequence above consists of all numbers that are 1 more than a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, 25). With that, the formula would be $a_n = n^2 +1$

### 17. Consider bit strings with length l and weight k (so strings of l 0’s and 1’s, including k 1’s). We know how to count the number of these for a fixed l and k. Now, we will count the number of strings for which the sum of the length and the weight is fixed. For example, let’s count all the bit strings for which l + k  11.

(a) Find examples of these strings of different lengths. What is the
longest string possible? What is the shortest?

(b) How many strings are there of each of these lengths. Use this to
count the total number of strings (with sum 11).

(c) The other approach: Let n  l + k vary. How many strings have
sum n  1? How many have sum n  2? And so on. Find and
explain a recurrence relation for the sequence (an) which gives
the number of strings with sum n.

(d) Describe what you have found above in terms of Pascal’s Triangle.
What pattern have you discovered?
