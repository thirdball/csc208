# Arithmetic and Geomtric Sequences
If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence is ***arithmetic***. If the initial term ($a_0$) of the sequence is a and the
**common difference** is d, then we have,

- Recursive definition: $a_n = a_{n-1}+d$
- Closed formula: $a_n = a + dn$

A sequence is called ***geometric*** if the ratio between successive terms is constant. Suppose the initial term $a_0$ is $a$ and the **common ratio** is $r$. Then we have
- Recursive definition: $a_n = ra_{n-1}$ with $a_0 = a$
- Closed formula: $a_n = a \times r^n$
