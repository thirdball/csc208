# 2.3 Notes
## Arithmetic sequences
Terms differ by a constant.
>$a_n = a_{n-1} + d$

**Closed Formula**:
> $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)$

## Geometric Sequences
  Ratio between successive terms is constant.
**Recursive Definition**:
  >$a_n = r \times a_{n-1}$

**Closed Formula**:
  >$(a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}$
