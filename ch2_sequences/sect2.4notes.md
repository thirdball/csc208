# 2.4 Notes

We have seen that it is often easier to find recursive definitions than closed formulas. Lucky for us, there are a few techniques for converting recursive definitions to closed formulas. Doing so is called solving a
**recurrence relation**.

a **recurrence relation** is a recursive
definition without the initial conditions.

**Telescoping** refers to the phenomenon when many terms in a large sum cancel out—so the sum “telescopes.”
