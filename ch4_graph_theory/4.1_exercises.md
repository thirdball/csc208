1. This is asking for the number of edges in $K_{10}$ .
 There are 10 verticies, which represent people that each shake 9 people's hands (degrees), which multiples to 90, but each edge is counted twice, so 90/2 = $45$.

 2. 5 x 2 = 10 and 10/2 = so the first one is possible, but not the second one since 3 x 5 =15 and 15/2 is 7.5 edges which isnt possible.

 4. They aren't the same since the second graph has no (a,b) edge. They are isomorphic though, and one possible isomorphism is f(a)=d,f(b)=c,f(c)=e,f(d)=b,f(e)=a
