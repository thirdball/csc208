1. You and your friends want to tour the southwest by car. You will visit the nine states below, with the following rather odd rule: you must cross each border between neighboring states exactly once (so, for example, you must cross the Colorado-Utah border exactly once). Can you do it? If so, does it matter where you start your road trip? What fact about graph theory solves this problem?

Yes, there is a Euler path for this, but you need to start in either Utah or Nevada, and end in the other state because they are the only states with 3 borders connected to other states. 

You can draw a graph with each state representing a vertice and each edge representing a border between two states. In this case, Utah and Nevada as vertices are the only ones with odd degrees.

Euler's theorem
1. If a graph has more than 2 vertices of odd degree then it has no Euler paths.
2. If a graph is connected and has 0 or exactly 2 vertices of odd degree, then it has at least
one Euler path
