1. You and your friends want to tour the southwest by car. You will visit the nine states below, with the following rather odd rule: you must cross each border between neighboring states exactly once (so, for example, you must cross the Colorado-Utah border exactly once). Can you do it? If so, does it matter where you start your road trip? What fact about graph theory solves this problem?

Yes, but you need to start in either Utah or Nevada, and end in the other state.You can draw a graph with each state representing a vertice and each edge representing a border between two states. Since Utah and Nevada are the only states with an odd degree, you have to start in one and end with the other.
