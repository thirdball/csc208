# 4.1 Graph Theory Notes

**Graph**: A graph is an ordered pair $G = (V, E)$ consisting of a nonempty set $V$
 (called the vertices) and a set $E$ (called the edges) of two-element subsets of .

 **Isomorphism**: An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely when they were connected by edges with their old names.
